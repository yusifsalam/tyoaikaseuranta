# Projektin ty√∂aikaseuranta (Project hours follow-up tool)

The goal of this project is to create a Flask web application that allows for tracking of project hours and tasks. Users within the projects have different roles: project lead (or instructor) can see the summaries from all users within a project on weekly, user or task-related basis. Project users record their hours, what type of work was done (from predefined categories) and a short description of what was done. Project users can see their own hours and summaries, but not other users' hours or summaries. 
The emphasis of this project is on the functionality of the database(s). 

Features to be implemented:

* Logging in
* Logging hours
* Creating a new project
* Adding a user to a project
* Removing a user from a project
* Summaries (reports)
