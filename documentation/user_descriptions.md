# User descriptions
There are three types (or roles) of users: 
- Unassigned user
- Project leader
- Project user

The roles are not mutually exclusive. For example, a user can be a project leader in Project A (where he has full control) and a project worker in Project B. 

## Unassigned user
After the initial registration, the user gets the role of unassigned user, meaning he is not involved in any projects at the moment.
Unassigned users can create new projects.

## Project leader
By default, a user that creates a project is assigned the role of project leader for that project. Project leaders can add users to their project, as well as remove project workers.
Additionally, project leaders have the ability to elevate project worker to the project leader status.

Project leaders can log tasks and view their task summaries, as well as summaries of all users in the project (including other project leaders). Project leaders can mark a project completed, after which new tasks cannot be added.
Project leaders can also delete their projects if they so desire. 

## Project worker
Unassigned users that are added to a project get the role of project worker (unless specifically elevated by their project leader).
Project workers can log tasks and view their task summaries.
